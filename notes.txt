useState hook -> accepts an initial state and returns two values:
                  The current state.
                  A function that updates the state.(also called as set function)
               const [state, setState] = useState(initialState)
                  useState(initialState)
                  set functions, like setSomething(nextState)
               example ->
               import { useState } from 'react';
                  function MyComponent() {
                  const [age, setAge] = useState(28);
                  const [name, setName] = useState('Taylor');
                  const [todos, setTodos] = useState(() => createTodos());
                  .....
               here we have used useState in TodoForm to store the input that we get from the user, 
               example the user types "shopping" in the input so your state is shopping  but your setvalue will start from 's' then 'sh' then 'sho' then 'shop' and so on....
